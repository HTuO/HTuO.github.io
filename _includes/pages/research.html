        <h3>Unique CADD tools for drug discovery</h3>
        <p>AtomForge’s physics-based force field is the engine that enables us to provide detailed insights into the structure composition and behavior of small molecules.</p>

        <p>Common challenges that CADD users face in their drug discovery are related to <br>structure conformational analysis, molecular dynamic simulations, and free energy perturbations (FEP).</p>

        <h3>Delivering on the Promises of In-Silico Drug Discovery</h3>
        <p>The introduction of conventional computer-aided drug discovery (CADD) tools revolutionized drug screening, improving hit rates from 0.1% to 1-30%. However, recent advancements in in-silico methods have plateaued, with modern technologies not consistently yielding favourable clinical outcomes. <br>AtomForge is a revolutionary tool for in-silico drug discovery, leveraging modern technology to meet the needs of industry leaders. It focuses on targeting previously “undruggable” proteins and advancing innovative therapeutic strategies like macrocyclic peptides and molecular glues. </p>

        <h3>Minimizing Clinical Failures</h3>
        <p>Non-specific drug interactions and off-target effects significantly contribute to toxicity, leading to failed clinical trials and substantial development costs. For instance, many clinical failures of small molecule GLP1R inhibitors are attributed to inadequate potency and high toxicity. By optimizing drug-target interactions for a more specific fit, the risk of toxicity issues, and associated expenses, can be minimized.</p>

        <h3>Unravelling the complexity of <span>Macrocyclic Peptides</span></h3>
        <p>Macrocyclic peptides combine the deliverability of small molecules with the specificity of protein-based therapies, presenting a promising therapeutic option. Traditional CADD methods have struggled with macrocyclic peptides, due to outdated physics models and rigid parameterization. AtomForge’s comprehensive parameterization allows our tools to provide valuable data for macrocyclic peptide based therapy projects. </p>

        <h3>Molecular Glues</h3>
        <p>“God made solids, but surfaces are the work of the devil” - Wolfgang Pauli <br>Targeted protein degradation strategies have revolutionized drug design, particularly with the emergence of molecular glue technology. This approach has led to the development of immunomodulatory imide drugs that target the interface between two protein surfaces, rather than conventional binding pockets. This shift poses a challenge for CADD tools, which are primarily designed for binding pockets and may struggle with the complexities of protein interactions. <br>AtomForge is particularly well-suited to support molecular glue development projects because of its dynamic charge model, which captures the intricate redistribution of charge at the protein-glue-protein interfaces. By leveraging AtomForge, researchers can improve hit detection and enhance lead optimization rates in this rapidly evolving field. </p>
