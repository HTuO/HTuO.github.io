        <h3>Unique CADD tools for drug discovery</h3>
        <p>AtomForge’s physics-based force field is the engine that enables us to provide detailed insights into the structure composition and behavior of small molecules.</p>

        <p>Common challenges that CADD users face in their drug discovery are related to <br>structure conformational analysis, molecular dynamic simulations, and free energy perturbations (FEP).</p>

        <h3>Delivering on the Promises of In-Silico Drug Discovery</h3>
        <p>The introduction of conventional computer-aided drug discovery (CADD) tools revolutionized drug screening, improving hit rates from 0.1% to 1-30%. However, recent advancements in in-silico methods have plateaued, with modern technologies not consistently yielding favourable clinical outcomes. <br>AtomForge is a revolutionary tool for in-silico drug discovery, leveraging modern technology to meet the needs of industry leaders. It focuses on targeting previously “undruggable” proteins and advancing innovative therapeutic strategies like macrocyclic peptides and molecular glues. </p>

        <h3>Minimizing Clinical Failures</h3>
        <p>Non-specific drug interactions and off-target effects significantly contribute to toxicity, leading to failed clinical trials and substantial development costs. For instance, many clinical failures of small molecule GLP1R inhibitors are attributed to inadequate potency and high toxicity. By optimizing drug-target interactions for a more specific fit, the risk of toxicity issues, and associated expenses, can be minimized.</p>

        <h3>Free Energy Calculations based on <span>AtomForge</span></h3>
        <p>(coming soon)</p>
        <p>We are currently developing a free energy calculation with the AtomForge force field at its core. Our aim is to use AtomForge’s unique features, such as dynamic charges, for a more advanced version of the FEP method. We expect to have a functional FEP-type method by the end of Q3 2025.</p>

        <h3>Core <span>Applications</span></h3>
        <p>The primary objective of our technology is to faithfully model the behaviour of drug-target interactions and more accurately predict binding energies, thus allowing better optimization of hit and candidate drug molecules. We have identified pharmaceutical, agricultural chemistry, and AI-based drug discovery companies as our target customers.</p>
