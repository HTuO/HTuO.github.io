### Scientific Marketing Associate

HTuO Biosciences is a rapidly growing company working at the interface of chemistry and computer programming. We are developing an advanced molecular modelling platform capable of accurately predicting the behaviour of molecules.  Our technology will be a major advance in the field of drug discovery, significantly improving the rate at which we can develop new drugs.

The Grant Writer is to play a key role in the stewardship of prospective and existing grants. You will be responsible for identifying new opportunities for non-dilutive funding, coordinating applications for funding, and for the effective management, reporting and control of grants obtained by HTuO Biosciences. 

As the Grant Writer, you will proactively develop strong relationships with key staff across the R&D, BD and Finance teams at HTuO Biosciences to ensure authentic and compelling proposals and reports, and facilitate appropriate grant submission, spending, and reporting. By using your strong scientific, business and technical writing background, you will become an expert on HTuO’s technology and business and facilitate our activities by sourcing creative funding opportunities. Lastly, you will play a key role in establishing research collaborations between HTuO and world-leading academic institutions. This will involve identifying potential collaborations, managing the communications between HTuO and the researchers, as well as identifying and securing granting options to fund the collaborations. 

This role will serve as the Grant Writer, primary administrative contact, and internal coordinator of all grant activities. The goal is to create a seamless transition from the moment we identify a funding opportunity, to submitting a proposal until the investment is complete and final reports submitted.

The ideal candidate will grow with the company and take on increasing leadership and responsibilities as the company matures. Consequently, we are looking for a candidate who brings experience in grant writing, has a deep interest in pharmaceutical applications of sciences, and is comfortable with the fast-paced environment of a young biotech company.
