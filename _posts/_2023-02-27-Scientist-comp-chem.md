### Scientist - Computational Chemistry

HTuO Biosciences is a rapidly growing company working at the interface of chemistry and computer programming. We are developing an advanced molecular modelling platform capable of accurately predicting the behaviour of molecules. When complete, HTuOâ€™s simulations will better predict the behaviour of drug-target interactions and more accurately predict binding energies, thus allowing better optimization of drug molecules. Our technology will be a major advance in the field of drug optimization, significantly improving the rate at which we can develop new drugs as well as the quality of those drugs.

We are seeking a computational chemist with good programming skills who will join our company to take on the computational drug development projects utilising our proprietary molecular modelling software and other computational chemistry methods. This will require collaboration with our partners, as well as the business development and technical team here at HTuO. The secondary objective of this role is to assist our technical team with the further development and refinement of our software. The ideal candidate will have experience in molecular modelling force fields and molecular dynamics simulations, with a background in quantum mechanics and computational drug design, as well as experience developing scripts and applications in Python/C++.  

At HTuO, we value creativity and integrity, and have high expectations from all of our staff. We believe in creating a diverse work environment that is balanced, supportive and encourages a healthy work-life balance

### Responsibilities
* Design and deliver both internal and external computational chemistry projects
* Assist with the development, parameterisation and validation of our molecular modelling platform
* Develop and manage R&D projects for both internal and external collaborations
* Help develop and implement metrics for validation of molecular simulations


### Qualifications
* PhD in computational chemistry, computer-aided drug design or equivalent experience
* Deep experience with molecular dynamics simulations and computer-aided drug design
* Development experience in Python would be a significant asset
* Background in ab initio quantum chemistry is a plus
* Early-stage computational drug development experience (hit-to-lead and lead optimization) is a plus
* Medicinal chemistry or pharmacology background is a plus
* Development experience in C++ is a plus


### Notes:
* Both qualified Canadian and international applicants are welcome to apply, but priority will be given to Canadian citizens and permanent residents.
* We encourage diversity and will not tolerate discrimination in any form.
* Only applicants that are selected for interviews will be contacted.
* Additional incentives include participation in the company stock option plan, health benefits and relocation assistance.
* Remote work is possible, but preference will be given to local candidates or candidates willing to relocate.
