### Scientist - CADD Data & Tools

HTuO Biosciences Inc. is looking for a computational scientist to design/develop the scientific framework for our comprehensive database of quantum chemistry and molecular dynamics simulation data, while leading the development of our CADD computational toolset. This role combines scientific design with hands-on development of analysis tools and algorithms for computational chemistry workflows.

### Who We Are

HTuO Biosciences is a rapidly growing biotechnology company working at the interface of drug discovery and computer programming, using a physics-based technology to accurately predict the behaviour and interactions between molecules. Our technology will be a major advance in drug discovery, significantly improving the rate at which we can develop new drugs.
At HTuO, we value creativity and integrity, and believe in creating a diverse work environment that is balanced, supportive, and encourages a healthy work-life balance.

### Location

Vancouver, BC (Hybrid, 2-3 days in office)

### Roles and Responsibilities:
* Architect the scientific framework for comprehensive database of quantum chemistry and molecular dynamics simulation data
* Lead CADD toolset development including statistical physics analyses, QM data I/O pipelines, and post-processing algorithms for computational chemistry workflows
* Build robust Python code following software engineering best practices: code standards, clean coding, version control, and testing frameworks
* Collaborate with computational chemists/biologists to translate data workflows into database schemas and analysis tools
* Collaborate with engineers to communicate scientific requirements and ensure production system integration
* Define conceptual framework enabling efficient storage, querying, and analysis of computational chemistry data across projects

### Qualifications:
* PhD in related fields (e.g. theoretical/computational physics, chemistry, biophysics, biochemistry, bioinformatics, or other sciences) or MS with equivalent experience.
* Strong foundation in mathematics and statistics with ability to understand and implement algorithms from the scientific literature.
* Experience with CADD methodologies and computational chemistry workflows
* Advanced Python programming skills with scientific computing libraries
* Experience building production-quality scientific software following engineering best practices including version control, testing frameworks, and clean code principles
* Ability to collaborate cross-functionally, bridging scientific and engineering teams while communicating technical requirements effectively
* Knowledge and/or experience in cloud computing, C/C++ programming, AI/ML for science, and contributions to open-source computational physics or chemistry software would be an asset.

### Company Benefits
* The annual base salary for this position ranges from $85,000-$105,000 CAD.
* Flexible hours, generous PTO and sick leave
* Health, dental and vision benefits
* Company stock option plan
